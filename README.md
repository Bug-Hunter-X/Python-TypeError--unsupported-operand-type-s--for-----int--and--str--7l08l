This repository demonstrates a common Python bug involving TypeErrors when performing calculations on lists containing mixed data types. The `bug.py` file contains code that throws a TypeError when trying to calculate the average of a list with both numbers and strings.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that handles this issue gracefully by checking for non-numeric elements before performing calculations. The solution uses error handling to prevent crashes and provide informative error messages to the user. This example showcases the importance of type checking and robust error handling in Python programming.
